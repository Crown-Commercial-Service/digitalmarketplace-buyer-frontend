      "serviceSummary": "CookieQ is a hosted service that can helps website publishers manage user consent or permissions across multiple web domains. Customers can configure it so that users are presented with a cookie \"opt-in\" panel or button and optional reminder banner to website visitors. CookieQ was the original solution released in May 2011 to the requirement for consent to cookies laid out in Regulation 6 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2011. The product has been enhanced with feedback from customers and now offers a complete consent platform capable of meeting any compliance requirements for consent management and communication. Consent can be managed in any number of multiple categories, using arbitrary names and fully configurable by the customer. For example consent indications such as Tracking=no, AnalyticsCookies=yes, DataCollection=yes can be stored for a particular use and communicated to any web domains that have been allocated by a \u201cdashboard\u201d customer facility. Data used to register consent such as current state, revocation period etc. is stored entirely within the user\u2019s browser and not simply in a domain specific cookie. Action on consent refusal in certain categories such as cookie and local storage removal can be entirely handled by CookieQ, so that no cookie placement is required, or alternatively session cookies can be used to signal consent status to particular web domain servers. Cookies or local storage used \u201cstrictly to support a service requested by the user\u201d do not need to be automatically removed. For the small number of browsers that do not support localStorage CookieQ stores the consent data in secure cloud storage. CookieQ uses Microsoft Windows Azure Storage tables for this. Microsoft guarantees that this information is replicated 3 times within the same data centre for resiliency against hardware failure and again replicated in another geographically separated data centre to provide additional data durability in the case of a major disaster. This platform can be configured either to offer an explicit opt-in mechanism whereby cookies & local storage are removed from their browser if the visitor has not opted in for particular customer defined or standard categories, or as an \"implied consent\" mechanism where cookies will not be removed by default but visitors can explicitly withdraw their consent whenever they wish. The styling and text of buttons and panels is completely configurable by the user, although various pre-baked styles are offered. Customers can design their own panels and banners retaining the look & feel of their website\u2019s branding using standard techniques such as declarative HTML or using JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, or we can design these User Interface elements for them. The service can be configured so that a user visiting a website with the W3C standard Do Not Track header signal set in their browser will be given a specific default such as Tracking=no, overriding any implied consent if that is in operation. Analytics services such as Google Analytics are specifically supported whereby they can continue to be used without the need to collect user identifying data or enable it to be sent to a third party not under the jurisdiction of European Data Protection or Privacy law. Once consent has been obtained it can be applied across any number of web domains owned by the same data controller. This means that if the Government explains a single privacy and cookie storage policy to a visitor a positive indication of consent will immediately be available to the servers of all its other website domains. A \"dashboard\" feature allows the customer to manage the consent settings on all its websites instantly without needing to take down servers, and only needs to install a single line script snippet on every site. Implicit, explicit or no consent can be controlled by the dashboard or by automatic geo-location based on the visitor's source IP address. The service now supports the W3C Tracking Protection Working Group (Do Not Track) consent API and has a built in tag management facility (or can support other external services such as the Google Tag Management service) to conditionally display third-party content contingent on a user's consent for storage or tracking. The service also includes a exhaustive and detailed report of client-side and server-side http cookies, 3rd party cookies, flash cookies, local storage and other information. CookieQ is an off-the-shelf solution but if further customisation or technical consultancy is required then this can be supplied. The CookieQ web application is hosted in the Microsoft Azure infrastructure, in Northern Europe data centres located in Dublin, Ireland and Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This hosting allows Baycloud to rapidly deploy new server instances to meet peak demands on the CookieQ website. Baycloud will ensure that enough roles are deployed so that over 7 days the CookieQ button, and the data registering consent for storage, can be rendered within an average of 500ms seconds to a browser used to visit a website implementing the CookieQ Service. Static files such as the CookieQ stylesheet files and the external files containing the CookieQ proprietary JavaScript are held on hosted servers managed by Baycloud Systems or in a suitable Content Delivery Network (CDN) such as the Windows Azure CDN. The CDN improves performance by caching content at locations closest to visitors to customer\u2019s websites. The Windows Azure CDN is a managed service that is operated by Microsoft and has a 99.99% monthly SLA. Customers are give authentication credentials so that they can login to the http://cookieq.com site and configure their implementation and manage all the domains in one place.",
