/**
 *  govUkInputs are shorter than our toolkit inputs, so while they're on pages
 *  which mix and match Toolkit and GOVUK Frontend, this class will make them
 *  conform to the Toolkit look.
 *
 *  I've created the class rather than applied it generally because we have lots
 *  of forms and I can't be sure I wouldn't be messing up the styling in other
 *  places. This does have the slightly inconvenient side effect of needing to
 *  remove instances of the classes in templates, etc when we remove this class.
 *  
 *  TODO: Remove this style and any instances of this class when we have fully
 *  migrated our forms to GOVUK Frontend.
