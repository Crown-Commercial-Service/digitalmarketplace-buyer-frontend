  <h2 id="what-is-the-digital-marketplace">What is the Digital Marketplace?</h2>
  <p>
    As part of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.innovation.gov.au/page/agenda">National Science and Innovation Agenda</a> the Marketplace is making it easier for digital businesses and government to work together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now in Beta, the Marketplace is about more than bringing a government panel available online. We’re building an end-to-end digital environment that makes all digital procurement easier — whether it’s straightforward, more complex or requiring a higher degree of collaboration and creativity.
  </p>

  <h2 id="why-use-the-digital-marketplace">Why use the Digital Marketplace?</h2>
  <p>The Marketplace can help you reach a better procurement outcome faster.</p>
  <p>It gives government buyers access to a large pool of approved digital businesses and it makes the procurement process simpler. First time buyers have reported they can create and publish a brief within 30 minutes. Briefs can remain open for 1 or 2 weeks. So, if what you need is straightforward, you can have a proposal or resumes on your desk in a little over a week.</p>


  <h2 id="who-can-be-a-buyer">Who can be a buyer?</h2>
  <p>
    If you work in government and you need digital services you can become a buyer in the Marketplace. Our buyers are from across local, state, territory and federal government, including entities such as the ABC, the National Museum of Australia and some universities.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have an email address ending in <strong>.gov.au</strong> you can create a buyer account now. If you work in government but your email is different, email your account request to <a href="mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au">marketplace@digital.gov.au</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>

From a <a href="{{ url_for('main.get_brief_by_id', framework_slug='digital-service-professionals', brief_id=163) }}">short assessment of a team’s capabilities</a>, to <a href="{{ url_for('main.get_brief_by_id', framework_slug='digital-service-professionals', brief_id=155) }}">software reviews for next-generation submarines</a> or <a href="{{ url_for('main.get_brief_by_id', framework_slug='digital-service-professionals', brief_id=93) }}">multi-million dollar website projects</a> and everything in between.

  <h2 id="the-buying-process">The buying process</h2>
  <p>
    Until now, successful procurement involved a lot of pre-research. Before you could go to market you had to carefully define your requirements and find a small group of potential sellers who could meet them. The Digital Marketplace turns this around. By posting what you need ‘Open to all’ buyers in the Digital Marketplace it’s easy to find sellers who are available and have the expertise you need. And it make the process easier, instead of going to Market you simply let the Market come to you.

  <h2 id="how-we-meet-procurement-rules">How we meet procurement rules</h2>

  <h3>Does the Digital Marketplace meet Commonwealth Procurement Rules?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, all sellers listed in the Marketplace are on the Digital Service Professionals Panel (SON3364729). This panel was established through an open approach to market by the Digital Transformation Office and meets the requirements of an open tender as set out in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the Marketplace makes it easy to comply with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, you’re still responsible for complying with these rules and any Accountable Authority Instructions related to procurement in your agency or issued by the Department of Finance. If you’re not sure of these requirements, please check with the procurement team in your own agency.
  </p>

  <h3>Does the Digital Marketplace meet local, state and territory procurement policies?</h3>
  <p>
    The NSW Government has already made it clear it’s embracing the Marketplace and that it meets policy requirements.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The use of the Digital Marketplace is fully compliant with the NSW Government’s procurement policies.</p>
    <footer><cite><a rel="external" href="https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/about-us/media-releases/nsw-government-first-collaborate-dto%E2%80%99s-new-digital-marketplace">NSW Government media release</a>, 14 September 2016</cite></footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Other local, state and territory government buyers are also welcome to use the Marketplace but should ensure that they comply with any additional procurement rules that apply in their state or territory. 
  </p>

  <h2 id="do-i-need-to-use-austender">Do I need to use AusTender as well?</h2>
  <p>
    You still need to meet the Department of Finance <a rel="external" href="https://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/buying/reporting-requirements/contracts-agency/principles.html">reporting requirements</a>, which include notifying AusTender of contracts (and contract amendments) that are valued at or above the reporting threshold within 42 days.
