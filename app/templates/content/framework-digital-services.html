      <h2 id="what-are-frameworks">
      <span class="number">1. </span>What are frameworks?</h2>
      <p>
        Government frameworks are agreements between the government and suppliers. The basic terms of use are agreed by both parties following a formal <a href="http://www.ojeu.eu/" rel="external">Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)</a> procurement process. This saves public sector organisations and suppliers the time and cost traditionally associated with individual procurement contracts. Buyers and suppliers still need to sign a ‘call-off contract’ for each service procured through a framework.

      <span class="number">2. </span>Frameworks on the Digital Marketplace</h2>
      <p>
        Public sector organisations can use the Digital Marketplace to access services from 3 frameworks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the G-Cloud framework, which includes cloud technology and support (eg web hosting or IT health checks)
        </li>
        <li>
          the Digital Services framework, which includes specialists for work on specific digital projects (eg technical architects and user researchers)
        </li>
        <li>
          the Crown Hosting Data Centres framework, which provides access to physical datacentre space for legacy systems
        </li>
      </ul>

      </h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        The basic terms of use are between the government and suppliers following a formal <a rel="external" href="http://www.ojeu.eu">Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)</a> procurement process. Suppliers on the Digital Services framework must:

      <h2 id="submit-services-to-the-digital-services-framework">
        <span class="number">4. </span>Submit services to the Digital Services framework
      </h2>
      <p>
        You can apply to submit your services to the Digital Services framework when an <a rel="external" href="http://www.ojeu.eu">Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)</a> is open. On average, an OJEU will be open for 6 weeks, every 6 to 9 months. It will be published on <a  rel="external" href="http://ted.europa.eu">Tenders Electronic Daily</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
        You’ll be asked to describe and show evidence of your capabilities when applying for a place on the framework. As part of this process, you’ll need to demonstrate that your methodology meets the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual" rel="external">Government Service Design Manual</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default" rel="external">Digital by Default Service Standard</a> for new or redesigned digital services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applications to the framework are evaluated by Government Digital Service (GDS) subject matter experts covering all 7 digital capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        A place on the framework is no guarantee of business to a supplier. For each digital project request for proposal (RFP) suppliers are invited to respond to, they’ll go through technical, cultural and commercial evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find the <a rel="external" href="http://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/contracts/rm1043ii">Digital Services framework</a> agreement on the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) website.
