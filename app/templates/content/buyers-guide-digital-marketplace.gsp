<span class="number">1. </span>Digital Marketplace overview</h2>
<p>
  The Digital Marketplace helps you find and compare cloud technology and people to deliver digital projects.
</p>
<p>
  It uses 3 frameworks (agreements between government and suppliers).
</p>
<p>
  Cloud services (eg web hosting or IT health checks) are on the G-Cloud framework.
</p>
<p>
  Specialists who can work on digital projects (eg technical architects and user researchers) are on the Digital Services framework.
</p>
<p>
  Physical datacentre space for legacy systems is available on the Crown Hosting Data Centres framework.
</p>
<p>
  All public sector organisations, including agencies and arm’s length bodies, can use the Digital Marketplace.
  <a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-organisations-eligible-to-use-cloudstore'>Check the list of approved organisations</a> to see if you’re eligible.
</p><p>
  All Digital Marketplace suppliers have successfully been through the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) process. That means you can save on the time and cost traditionally associated with entering into individual procurement contracts.
</p>

<h2 id="g-cloud-order-form">

  1 supplier provides datacentre hosting to government. It offers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    mission-critical datacentres for legacy systems
  </li>
  <li>
    a flexible, pay-for-what-you-use model
  </li>

    secure facilities
  </li>
  <li>
    power uptime availability that exceeds Tier III+
  </li>
  <li>

<p>
  You must still follow best practice for procurement when using the Digital Marketplace, which includes making your decision-making process auditable.
</p>
<h2 id="g-cloud-order-form">
  <span class="number">3. </span>Preparing your requirements</h2>
<p>We recommend working with both procurement and technical professionals to establish the requirements and timescales of your project.</p>
<p>You should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
the funds you have available to buy the service
</li><li>
the technical and procurement requirements of the project
</li><li>
the selection criteria on which your choice will be based
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Identify what the ‘must-have’ requirements are and what the ‘wants’ are through an outcome-based request for proposal (RFP). Refer to the government's <a href='https://www.gov.uk/service-manual'>Service Design Manual</a> to help you describe your needs.
</p>
<p>
GDS holds the government’s <a href='https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/spending-controls.html'>digital and IT spend control</a>. This means that all funding requests for new or redesigned digital services need formal approval by GDS before they can go ahead. You’ll also need to have approval from within your organisation.
</p>
