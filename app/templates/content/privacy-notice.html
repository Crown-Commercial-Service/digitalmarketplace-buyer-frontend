      <p class="govuk-body">The Digital Marketplace is built and run by the Cabinet Office.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Cabinet Office is the data controller. A data controller determines how and why personal data can be processed. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053" rel="external">Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register for more information</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-xmedium">What data we collect from you</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="check-list">
        <p class="govuk-body-l">We collect several pieces of personal data from our users. These are:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>email addresses, phone number and address</li>
          <li>company name and contact information (suppliers only)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">We use this data when you create a user account to buy or sell digital services.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Your email address and contact details</h3>
      <div class="check-list">
        <p class="govuk-body-l">When you give us your email we will only use it so that you can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>sign in securely</li>
          <li>be contacted about a particular contract, application or brief</li>
          <li>receive updates from a mailing list you’ve subscribed to (for example if you’ve asked to be notified when a new framework opens)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Your company information</h3>
      <div class="check-list">
        <p class="govuk-body-l">If you register as a supplier on the Digital Marketplace, you need to provide us with several pieces of data, including your company contact information. We use that data to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>inform buyers who they can get in touch with at your company</li>
          <li>register a company on a framework to sell services</li>
          <li>update you on the status of your applications to frameworks or briefs</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will always be told if the personal data you provide is going to be displayed on the Digital Marketplace.</p>

      <h3>Information about criminal convictions and company directors</h3>
      <div class="check-list">
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll ask you if you have any criminal convictions.</p>

         <p class="govuk-body-l">If you’re a supplier applying to join a framework we’ll also ask if your company director has been:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>convicted of bribery</li>
          <li>declared bankrupt within the last 5 years</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">We use this information to help make a decision about your application.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The legal basis for processing this data is because it is ‘necessary for reasons of substantial public interest for the exercise of a function of a government department’ (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/" rel="external">Article 6 of The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>). This means we’re legally allowed to process this data because it’s in the public interest that government checks this information about suppliers.</p>
