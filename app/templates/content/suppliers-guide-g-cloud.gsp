<span class="number">1. </span>Digital Marketplace and G-Cloud</h2>

<p>
Public sector organisations and arm’s length bodies can use the Digital Marketplace to buy cloud-based services, like web hosting, site analytics or document collaboration tools.
</p><p>
If you want to sell your cloud services on the Digital Marketplace, you need to submit your service details via the G-Cloud framework.
</p><p>
You can apply to submit your services to the G-Cloud framework when an Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) is open. On average, an OJEU will be open for 6 weeks, every 6 to 9 months.
</p><p>
Once your submission has been processed, buyers will be able to find your service live on the Digital Marketplace.
</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">
<span class="number">2. </span>How to apply</h2>

<p>You must:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign up to the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) eSourcing Portal.</li>
<li>Register your expression of interest on the CCS eSourcing Portal when the OJEU opens.</li>
<li>Answer the invitation to tender (ITT) questions on the CCS eSourcing Portal.</li>
<li>Submit company and service information to the Digital Marketplace using the service submission portal (SSP).</li>
<li>Wait for assurance checks to be made on your information.</li>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Each step in this process is mandatory.

<h3 id="register">
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Sign up to the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) eSourcing Portal
</h3>

<p>
Start your application by signing up to the <a rel="external" href="https://crowncommercialservice.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml">CCS eSourcing Portal</a>.
</p>

<p>You'll need a <a rel="external" href="http://salesmarketing.dnb.co.uk/find_my_company/">Data Universal Numbering System (<abbr title="Data Universal Numbering System">DUNS</abbr> number</a>) first.</p>

<h3 id="email-your-expression-of-interest-for-new-suppliers-only">
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Register your expression of interest</h3>

<p id="email">
You need to register your expression of interest in being listed on the G-Cloud framework using the CCS eSourcing Portal. Only register your interest when an OJEU is open.
</p>
<p>
You’ll get an acknowledgement of your interest to apply for G-Cloud.
</p>

<p>
Next, log in to the CCS eSourcing Portal and accept the invitation to tender (ITT).
</p>

<h3 id="answer">
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Answer the ITT questions on the CCS eSourcing Portal</h3>

<p>
Once you’ve accepted the ITT, you should complete the ITT form on the CCS eSourcing Portal. Your answers must give specific details about the services you provide. Services need to meet the definition of cloud computing services as described in the
<a rel="external" href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf">official recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST).
</p><p>
You must answer all questions. You might not be accepted on to the framework if you don’t.
</p><p>
After submitting answers to individual questions, make sure you select ‘submit all’ to complete your application. You’ll get an email from CCS when they get your application.
</p><p>
All communication between suppliers and CCS must take place through the CCS eSourcing Portal.
</p>

<h3 id="submit">
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Submit your service details and documents</h3>

<p>
Next, you need to submit your service information through the service submission portal (SSP). You can access the SSP from the CCS eSourcing Portal or direct from <a rel="external" href="http://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk">the Digital Marketplace home page</a>.
</p>

<p>
You’ll be asked to include information like a short service description, key product features and benefits, and pricing details.
</p>

<p>
Each service you want to include needs to fit into one of 4 categories, or 'lots':
</p>

<ul>
<li>Lot 1 - Infrastructure as a Service (<abbr title="Infrastructure as a Service">IaaS</abbr>)</li>
<li>Lot 2 - Platform as a Service (<abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr>)</li>
<li>Lot 3 - Software as a Service (<abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr>)</li>
<li>Lot 4 - Specialist Cloud Services </li>
</ul>
<p>
To complete the process, you need to submit your details through both the CCS eSourcing Portal and the SSP.
</p>


<h4 id="adding-or-amending-a-service">Documents you need to include</h4>

<p>
Before you can submit a cloud service to the Digital Marketplace, you need to use the SSP to attach:
</p>

<ul>
<li>a terms and conditions (specific to that service) document</li>
<li>a service definition document</li>
<li>a pricing document</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can also attach a Skills for the Information Age (SFIA) rate card.
</p>

<p>
All documents should be in an <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/open-document-formats-selected-to-meet-user-needs">open format</a>.

<h4 id="service-definition-document">Service definition document</h4>

<p>
You must submit a separate service definition document for each service you supply. The contents of this will appear next to the relevant service in the Digital Marketplace but will not be indexed by search. You should include all information necessary for buyers to evaluate and shortlist the service.
</p>
<p>
Don’t include hyperlinks marketing the service or pricing information. You can mention your website as a source of information on the company.
</p>

<h4 id="pricing-document">Pricing document</h4>

<p>Your pricing document will determine what price appears next to your service on the Digital Marketplace. You can refer to the ITT documentation for more detail on what to include.</p>

<h4 id="terms-and-conditions">Terms and conditions</h4>

<p>
These terms are fixed: they can’t be changed during the lifetime of the framework.
</p><p>
There can only be one set of terms and conditions on the Digital Marketplace for each cloud service.
</p><p>
Note that the terms and conditions document is not the signed framework agreement signature page between CCS and the supplier.
</p>


<h3 id="yourinfo">
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Assurance checks will be made on your information</h3>

<p>
CCS checks the cloud services listed on the Digital Marketplace to make it easier for buyers to find and evaluate them.
</p><p>
The information you provide for each service is checked against the service definitions submitted for each service as part of the assurance process.
</p><p>
After you submit your application, it will be evaluated against a set of criteria published in the ITT pack. CCS will evaluate applications against a core set of criteria, as well as against a set of lot-specific criteria.
</p><p>
The features are assured so that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the service is suitable for the framework</li>
<li>a consistent base level of information on the Digital Marketplace is given</li>
<li>buyers are aware of core service features</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="live">
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Your services will go live on the Digital Marketplace</h3>

<p>If you’re successful in your application, you’ll enter a framework agreement with G-Cloud. Your services will be made available on the Digital Marketplace as soon as the framework goes live.
</p><p>
Customers who want to buy your services must enter into a call-off contract with you and accept the terms and conditions you submitted at the time of application. The maximum length of a call-off contract is 24 months.
</p>
<p>
The G-Cloud framework is unlike most other frameworks because it incorporates the suppliers’ terms and conditions. In the case of any contradiction between the supplier’s service terms and conditions, and the framework terms and conditions, the framework terms will take precedence.
</p>

<h2 id="when-to-apply">
<span class="number">3. </span>When to apply</h2>

<p>A new version of the G-Cloud framework is released about every 6 months. Each version of the framework runs for 12 months so frameworks will overlap. </p>

<h3 id="new-suppliers">
<span class="number">3.1 </span>New suppliers</h3>

<p>
All cloud services on the Digital Marketplace are part of the G-Cloud framework – a catalogue of services where the basic terms of use have already been agreed between the government and suppliers. This means buyers can buy services without running a full tender process.
</p>

<p>
If you’re new to G-Cloud you can tender to supply services when a new version is published on the Official Journal of the European Union (<abbr title="Office Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>). You don’t need to be based in the UK to apply to the framework, but you need to agree to the terms of the framework agreement and call-off contract, which are governed by English law.
</p>

<p>Follow the steps in <a href="#apply">‘How to apply’</a> to submit a new tender. </p>


<h3 id="existing-suppliers">
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Existing suppliers</h3>

<p>You can make updates to the services you offer and make bids for supplying new services whenever a new version of the G-Cloud framework is released. You’ll get a 'contract notice' (formal notification telling all potential suppliers about a public sector contract opportunity) from the <abbr title="Office Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr> ahead of each new release of the framework.</p>

<p>You’ll need to resubmit your tender before your framework agreement expires so you can continue to offer services. </p>

<h4 id="suppliers-on-g5">Suppliers on G6</h4>
<p>G-Cloud 6 ends January 2016. </p>

<h4 id="suppliers-on-g5">Suppliers on G5</h4>
