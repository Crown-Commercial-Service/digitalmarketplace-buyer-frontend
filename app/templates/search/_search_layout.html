      the element referenced by an `aria-controls=` seems to need to be persistent -
      at least I wasn't able to get it to work by just re-using a fragment of the
      existing search summary text, as it gets removed and replaced wholesale by
      the javascript when a new set of results is fetched.

      instead, we have this dedicated (and more importantly, persistent) wrapper
      element, which itself can be the target of `aria-controls=`
